<Problem description>
Array 'arr' is given. 
Each element of the array arr consists of the numbers 0 through 9. 
At this time, remove all but one consecutive number from the array arr. 
However, when returning the numbers remaining after removal, 
the order of the elements in the array arr must be maintained. 
For example,
  - If arr = [1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1], [1, 3, 0, 1] is returned.
  - If arr = [4, 4, 4, 3, 3], [4, 3] is returned.
Complete the solution function to remove the consecutive numbers from the array arr and return the remaining numbers.



<I/O example>
     arr		  answer
[1,1,3,3,0,1,1]	   =>	[1,3,0,1]
  [4,4,4,3,3]	   =>	  [4,3]
